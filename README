NOTE: Please see "EH_Code_readme.txt" for updates to Salis work done by Evan Henrich, summer 2015

This is a software implementation of the Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) Calculator.

The RBS Calculator can predict the translation initiation rate of a protein coding sequence in bacteria. It can also design synthetic ribosome binding site sequences to rationally control the protein expression level. It combines a thermodynamic model of ribosome and mRNA interactions with a sequence optimization algorithm. The RBS Calculator was developed by Howard Salis and Chris Voigt at UC San Francisco.

Please read H.M. Salis, E.A. Mirsky, C.A. Voigt, Nature Biotechnology, 2009 for technical details.

**  A New and Improved Version of the RBS Calculator Has Been Developed with Greater Predictive Accuracy and a User-Friendly Web Interface  **
The first round of improvements have been described in:  HM Salis, "The Ribosome Binding Site Calculator", Synthetic Biology: Methods for Building and Programming Life, 19
The second round of improvements have been described in:  AE Borujeni, AS Channarasappa, HM Salis, "Translation rate is controlled by coupled trade-offs between site accessibility, selective RNA unfolding and sliding at upstream standby sites", Nucleic Acid Research, 2013
Additional rounds of improvements have already been validated and will be published in the future.
